    "Now we have all ingredients to continue binning: the scaffolds and bam files containing reads mapped on those scaffolds. \n",
    "In metagenomics, binning is the process of grouping reads or contigs and assigning them to operational taxonomic units. \n",
    "Binning methods can be based on either compositional features, alignment (similarity), or both.\n",
    "`metabat2` uses both the contig depth and tetra-nucleotide frequencies to bin the contigs. \n",
    "Every bin will ideally represent one microbial genome from one particular microbe that was in the original DNA extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the binning process, is to calculate the contig depths from all bam files that were created before.\n",
    "All these depths are stored in one big table, which is then passed to `metabat2`.\n",
    "We achieve this with a script that comes with `metabat2`: `jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths`\n",
    "\n",
