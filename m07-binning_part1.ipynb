    "Now we have all ingredients to continue binning: the scaffolds and bam files containing reads mapped on those scaffolds. In metagenomics, binning is the process of grouping reads or contigs and assigning them to operational taxonomic units. Binning methods can be based on either compositional features, alignment (similarity), or both. Metabat2 uses both the contig depth and tetra-nucleotide frequencies to bin the contigs. Every bin will represent one operational taxonomic unit that can be found in the metagenome.\n",
