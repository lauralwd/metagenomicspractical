# Management summary

## Introduction
In this document I describe and evaluate some of my efforts to improve a one day computer practical in the early Masters course 'intro to bioinformatics'. 
Specifically, this is a metagenomics practical tought in Februari 2019.
The practical teaches a workflow starting with DNA sequencing reads, and ending at listing genes and pathways in draft microbial genomes acquired from these DNA sequencing reads.
A 1.5 hour leture elaborates on the entire workflow. 
The 6 hour computer practical focusses on the part after meta-genome assembly until gene annotation and visualisation. 
This focus was introduced due to computational limits.
Learning goals of the practical are (taken from the [ReadME](https://github.com/lauralwd/metagenomicspractical/blob/master/README.md)): 
> * After this practical, you can name and explain the steps of a simple metagenomics workflow. Starting at acquiring sequencing data, all the way to annotation of individual draft genomes.
>   * You can highlight the differences between ‘regular’ genome sequencing data and assemblies versus metagenomic sequencing data and assemblies.
>   * You can replicate the workflow taken during the practical.
>   * You can explain the workflow from biological and technical perspectives when either one or both are appropriate. 
>   * You can design similar workflows for different metagenomic questions.
>   * You can explain what binning signals are, why they are used and how you used them during the practical.
> * If not already, you will understand the basics of the bash computer language and be able to run bio-informatic programmes in loops.

### observations
During past itterations of the course, teaching staff had noticed repeatedly that the questions of students were very technical and practical in nature. 
Most questions lacked the depth one would hope to achieve in a Masters course.
Explaining technical details to students by challenging them with questions about the biological relevance of the challenge at hand failed mostly. 
These two phenomena usually increased in severity during the practical. 
Also many students failed a simple opening question in an open book exam that asked students to reproduce the order of steps taken in the workflow during the practical. 
I interpret from these observations that the students are overwhelmed by the technical and concrete tasks and hence have no thinking space/energy/time left to connect the concrete tasks to a biological context. 
Past attempts included: expanding explaination in the practical, focussing the lecture on the workflow, providing hand-outs of the workflow and point students to the provided workflow when asking questions. 
All these attempts were unsuccessfull in removing the beforementioned observations.

--> cognitive load theory <-- 

Here I try to improve learning outcome of this one day excercise by reducing/managing student cognitive load during the practical. 
I theorise that requiring the students to explicitly draw the workflow before starting, and placing checkmarks in the workflow when proceeding with the practical, will enable them to more easily connect the concrete tasks to the abstract concepts of the workflow.

**Research question** 
Is the use of self-made flowcharts before and during a computerpractical an efficient method to improve conceptual understanding of a metagenomics workflow in a class of first years Life Sciences Masters students in a course 'introduction to bioinformatics'.

## Methods

The intervention material is hosted and versioned on github, 
a [hand-out detailing the assingment for students](https://github.com/lauralwd/metagenomicspractical/blob/8d7ff3000841746393bbdca85cb82fa94fa48e42/docs/assignment_flowchart.md) 
and a [hand-out to draw the flowcharts on](https://github.com/lauralwd/metagenomicspractical/blob/8d7ff3000841746393bbdca85cb82fa94fa48e42/docs/fill-in_flowchart.pdf)
Both are versions of Februari 2019.

Welke interventie heb ik gedaan

>Na volledig college en lezen instructie krijgen studenten de opdracht een overzicht van de workflow te tekenen. Deze word vervolgens klassikaal besproken. Tijdens het practicum zetten ze vinkjes // markeeringen bij de stappen uit deze eerste flowchart. Tegelijkertijd maken ze op de achterzijde van hetzelfde invul-vel een nieuwe flowchart die zo precies mogelijk aangeeft hoe de workflow er uit ziet. Achteraf reflecteren de studenten op de verschillen tussen de twee flowcharts. Zo sluit de les af met een belangrijk leerdoel, en tijdens het practicum word 1) structuur expliciet geforceerd 2) compartmentalisatie van practicum handelingen gefaciliteerd.
>
> Na elke praktische stap de llnen deze stap: (1) af laten vinken in flowchart als aanwezig. of (2) toe laten voegen in flowchart.

### Research population
First year masters students partaking in the course 'introduction to bioinformatics'

Data analysis
* Analyse flowcharts before starting the practical and flowcharts made during the practical.
* Analyse exam results of this years course and those of past years.
* Talk to students about their impression of the excercise

## Results

Hoe is de interventie verlopen
Nearly all students created the flowchart before starting the practical. Only two students followed up on the assignment by constructing a second flowchart during the practical.

Talking to the students about the excersise, they indicated creating the flowcharts helped in keeping oversight of the tasks at hand. It seems questions were less technical in nature, however there is no quantative data of this or past years to quantify this impression.

Wat is er uit mijn analyses gekomen
Pending

## Conclusions

Wat is het antwoord op mijn onderzoekbare onderwijsvraag

Still unanswered. While my personal impression from the students' feedback was very positive, too much data is missing to analyse the data as was planned. Instead, I will redo the excercise next year in an adapted form. I will not require the students to interupt their practical tasks, but only to reflect formaly on their flowcharts.
