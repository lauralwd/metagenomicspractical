# Metagenomics practical
Welcome in today's metagenomics practical. Besides finishing the practical, you have three assignments this day, listed below. The goal of these assignments is to improve your understandig of todays  workflow by explicitly drawing relations between te steps. These assignments are not graded and play no role in the final exam.

## Assignment 1
First, before you start the workflow but after the lecture and reading the introduction, draw a flowchart of the workflow you will follow today. It does not have to be complete, but it has te represent what you got from the lecture and instruction. Draw this flowchart on side 1 of the sheet of paper handed out to you. Even though you will run the calculations in pairs, please each draw your own flowchart without discussing the contents with your fellow students. The flowcharts do not have to be the same or correct for that matter. This is mainly an excersise allow you to better understand the various steps and their relations to each oter.

## Assignment 2
During todays practical, do two things:
1. When you finish a step that is included in your first flowchart, please place a little checkmark next to it.
2. While you progress in the practical, draw a new flowchart reflecting your progress.

## Assignment 3
While making the second flowchart, reflect on what steps where not included in your first, and if they were neccessary to understand the flow. Do you still understand all steps and why they matter? Be sure to discuss with each other and the instructors present.

##  Why I want to have your flowcharts
After the practical you must hand in your flowcharts, you off course are allowed to make a copy or a photo for future reference.
### Improve the practical
I require you to hand in your flowcharts after the practical to study them and improve the didactics of this practical. Your flowcharts are important to understand your thinking, and based upon your work I will improve the practical for future itterations. Please do fill in your name on the sheet, it may be valuable to relate your flowcharts to the results of the exams. The contents of the flowcharts will be absoletelly of **no consequence to your final grade**, not in a positive nor in a negative way.

### Consent for publication
At some point, there is a possibility that I might use your flowcharts to publish this practical and the improvements thereupon in an educational journal. If you agree your flowcharts content can be an **anonymous** data point in such a manuscript, please check the consentbox at the bottom of the flowchart.
