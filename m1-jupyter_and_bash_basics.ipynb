    "# How to work in a Jupyter notebook with the Bash language\n",
    "The webpage you are looking at, is called a jupyter notebook. It is a webpage on which you can write text (like this text) and also code. The code can ben executed an the output you see again within the same notebook! This may sound trivial, but it's really \"cool\". To put it in non-scientific terms. Code and text are entered in individual cells, a code cell or a text cell. This cell you are reading now is obviously a text cell. Now let's look at a code cell and execute it. There are two ways of executing a cell. First you select a cell, either with your mouse pointer, or you move there with the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard. Then you execute it by hitting the 'run' button in the toolbar above, or you hit CTRL+RETURN."
