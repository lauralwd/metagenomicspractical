The final CheckM results will give you a good overview of the bins with low contamination and high completeness and show the bin's lowest taxonomic rank. Pick a bin that you think is interesting to study further. Alternatively, you may also make a loop to annotate multiple bins.\n",

Next, some hypotheses are derived and tested in the wet lab. Does your plot of the nitrogen metabolism overlap with the one published? Or did you maybe discover a new endophyte!\n",
