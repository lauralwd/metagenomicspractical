    "## Checking completeness and contamination using CheckM\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the bins made with metabat we can check them for contamination and completeness (quality), for this we will use CheckM. CheckM provides a set of tools for assessing the quality of genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes. It provides robust estimates of genome completeness and contamination by using collocated sets of genes that are ubiquitous and single-copy within a phylogenetic lineage (also called marker/signature genes). http://ecogenomics.github.io/CheckM/\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will be able to see in the checkm help pages, checkm has a workflow (lineage_wf) that will run all nessecary steps to asses bin quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lineage_wf (lineage-specific workflow) steps: <br>\n",
    "- The tree command places genome bins into a reference genome tree.\n",
    "- The lineage_set command creates a marker file indicating lineage-specific marker sets suitable for evaluating each indivudual bin with the most appropriate reference set of markers. \n",
    "- This marker file is passed to the analyze command in order to identify marker genes and estimate the completeness and contamination of each genome bin. \n",
    "- Finally, the qa command can be used to produce different tables summarizing the quality of each genome bin. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the 'tree' part of this workflow is too memmory intensive (about 32Gbytes of RAM (!) ) So we will cheat a bit. Instead, we will use the `checkm taxonomy_wf Domain Bacteria` command. Hence, we don't load the full tree to find the most appropriate marker set, but assume all are bacteria (reasonable assumption in this case) and don't look any deeper than that. \n"
