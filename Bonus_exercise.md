# Bonus exercise: Phylogeny of your bins

Congratualations! You completed the practial and are brave enough to try a bonus! In this exercise you will:

1. Extract Single Copy Marker Genes from your CheckM run on the Bins you created.
2. Allign these SCMGs in a multple-sequence alignment
  * using MAFFT
  * and using JalView to visualise and check your alignment
3. Create a phylogenetic tree using
  * Fast-tree (quick and dirty)
  * IQ-TREE propper but slower
4. Inspect the tree
  * online via iTOL
  
  The entire exercise takes place in a terminal, not in a jupy notebook. So keep this instruction, and open up a terminal!
