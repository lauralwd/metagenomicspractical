# Metagenomicspractical
This repository contains **answers/prefilled code** for a practical for learning a metagenomics workflow.
These lessons are aimed at Master's students in Life Sciences with minimal experience in bioinformatics and bachelor level experience in (micro)biology.
Find the main page for this workflow in the main branch.
Renders of the empty and pre-filled workflow are available as a github pages website in the 'gh-pages' branch and online [here](https://lauralwd.github.io/metagenomicspractical/).

# Credits and references
Original practical (version 2017) was made By Margo Schuller and Laura Dijkhuizen. 
The current version was improved thereupon by [Laura Dijkhuizen](https://www.lauradijkhuizen.com). 
The practical is based on a subset of published data. 
The original paper is published open-access in New Phytologist:
