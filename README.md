# metagenomicspractical
Hands-on practical for learning metagenomic tools aimed at Masters Studens. The practical discusses a metagenomics workflow from acquiring sequencing data up top binned microbial genome annotation. Steps up to and including assembly have already been performed for feasibility. This practical includes:
* backmapping (bwa+samtools)
* binning (MetaBAT)
* quality controll of bins (CheckM)
* annotation (Prokka)


Original practical (version 2017) was made By Margo Schuller and Laura Dijkhuizen. Current version was improved thereupon by [Laura Dijkhuizen](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/LWDijkhuizen). The practical is based on a subset of published data, the original paper is published open-access in New Phytologist:
